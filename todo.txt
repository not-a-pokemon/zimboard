Now that it's the second commit, it's much better but still lacks a lot of
features. It is now, practically speaking, something in the "barely usable"
category. Still lacks good tag search.

'such hash already exists' but post still saved in list. In general, purge posts marked as unfinished.
+ Purging such posts is a separate step.

+ SQL statements are now finalized.

Currently, search is not fast at all.
+ Added query caching.
It's not currently obvious if it is good or not, but later I'll see.
No cache updates on post tag change or post addition now.
+ Made it.
Old cache entry deletion is yet to be tested.

BUGS:
Sometimes page load fails with "sqlite: There is nothing left to pop".
It can be related to the fact I use multithreading with sqlite incorrectly.
Solution: make the *mem-db* thread-local.
